# Sharing Report

The SharePoint and OneDrive Sharing Report shows the sharing links and external shares across a single tenant's SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts, drawing attention to the riskiest ones — anonymous links, anonymous links that allow editing or never expire, and shares reaching external recipients. It requires a single tenant to be selected and is not available for All Tenants. The data is compiled from cached scans that you trigger and keep current from this page, and the report can be exported as a PDF.

## Syncing Sharing Data

The report reads from cached scans rather than querying SharePoint and OneDrive live. The first time you open it for a tenant there is no data yet, and a prompt invites you to run a scan. The controls at the top of the page build and refresh that data.

| Control       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sync data     | Queues scans of the tenant's SharePoint sites and OneDrive accounts for sharing links, together with SharePoint and OneDrive usage data. Scanning every drive can take a while on large tenants. Progress is shown next to the button, and the report refreshes itself once the scans finish. |
| Refresh       | Reloads the report from the cached data without running a new scan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Export report | Generates a PDF of the current report for the selected tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The time of the last scan is shown as "Last data refresh."
